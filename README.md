# Finance-and-Finetech-project
## This project, completed as part of the MSc program in Finance and FinTech, focuses on the financial analysis and valuation of two major companies: Novartis and Walmart. The study includes comprehensive stock valuation using comparables and the Dividend Discount Model (DDM), bond valuation, beta calculations, and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) analysis. 
## Additionally, portfolio optimization strategies were explored, including Maximum Sharpe Ratio, Minimum Volatility, and Equal-Weighted Portfolios, to determine the ideal investment allocation. Finally, the dividend policies of both firms were evaluated to identify whether they align more with value or growth-oriented strategies.
