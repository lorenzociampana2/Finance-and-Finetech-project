# Finance-and-Finetech-project
This project, completed as part of the BSc class in Finance and FinTech, focuses on the financial analysis and valuation of two major companies: Novartis and Walmart. The study includes Stock Valuation using comparables and the Dividend Discount Model (DDM), Bond Valuation, Beta calculations, and Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) analysis. 

Additionally, some portfolio optimization strategies were explored, including Maximum Sharpe Ratio, Minimum Volatility, and Equal-Weighted Portfolios, so that we could determine the ideal investment allocation.

Finally, the dividend policies of both firms were evaluated to identify whether they align more with value or growth-oriented strategies.
